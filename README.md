# Intent-Recognition-System-Development-
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an intent recognition system capable of accurately understanding user intents conveyed through natural language input. The system should be able to classify user queries or commands into predefined categories or intents, enabling effective interaction between users and the system.

## âœ” To perform Intent Recognition, these are the steps:

### ðŸ”³Import Libraries

### ðŸ”³Data Collection

### ðŸ”³Data Cleaning 
As We canâ€™t directly process this data. First, we have to clean it, this usually includes, removing punctuation marks or anything which might produce unwanted results. This is also done to reduce number of tokens, as we donâ€™t want to tokenize everything.

### ðŸ”³Data Preprocessing
Next step is to preprocess the data to make it suitable for training a neural network. This usually involves tokenization, which means breaking down each input sentence into individual words or sub-words.
But firstly, we need to prepare data in a format {intent : text data}

### ðŸ”³Tokenization and Embedding 
With our data prepared, we can utilize TensorFlow's built-in tokenizer to perform both tokenization and embedding efficiently.

### ðŸ”³Feature Extraction
Neural networks require numerical representations of sentences to function. To achieve this, we perform feature extraction by mapping each word to its index and creating a matrix that corresponds to its category (intent).
